Properties are key and value pairs you set for your items, in a manner that's defined by the concept of many-to-one (many properties to
an item) - which can be used in many circumstances. These properties, either previously defined or defined by you can be used to
control specific aspects of the item you're setting these properties on. To start adding item properteis:
<ol>
    <li>Set the key of the item property. Make sure you set it unique. Usually one property key must be unique for that item.</li>
    <li>Enter the value of the key. This can be anything, as per provided documentation, or anything you can think of or need to
    specify. The possibilities are endless.</li>
</ol>
