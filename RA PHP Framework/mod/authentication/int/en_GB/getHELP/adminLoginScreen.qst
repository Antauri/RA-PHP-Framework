If you're really an administrator, moderator or any other kind of user with special powers, enter your username and password in the
fields bellow and you will be granted access to those parts of the application you are allowed to have access to. If not, GET OUTTA
HERE quick before we call the cops! If you mistakenly enter an username and password more than three times and they don't match, you're going to get banned for 1 hour, in the hope that this will try to prevent unauthorized access in the backend of your application.
