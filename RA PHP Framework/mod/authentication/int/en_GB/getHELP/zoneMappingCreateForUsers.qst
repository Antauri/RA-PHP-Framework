Permissions can be set on a per-group basis. But for some project that's not enough. We give you the possibility to allow permissions on a per-user
basis. How this is managed is simple: an user, when authenticated would inherit the permissions of the group he's in. After that, specific permissions
of the user, if they exists, are merged with the ones from the group. The merging gives back the ACL for that user and maps
access or restrictions of that user to specific features of your project.
