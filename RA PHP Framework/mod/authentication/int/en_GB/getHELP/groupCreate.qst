Groups are usually "containers" of users. Meaning that they are made-up out of users and are applied permissions. These permissions, set
on a specific group thus apply to all the members (users) of the group. Having groups, means that an administrator of this application
does not need to apply permissions to each and every user, instead, he does only one operation of adding one set of permissions for
a group. Thus, keeping users at bay is done, organized through the concept of users, groups and ACL (Access Control Lists) where users
are mapped to groups and groups are given permissions (allowed, denied) to specific zones.
