Zones define areas that are restricted to be accessed only by users of a specific group (that were previously given access) or by users
having predefined mappings for the current zone. Although, many of the zones defined here are added automatically from executing PHP
code, by your developers and administrator with proper knowledge can use this form to add more zones to your application, instead of
mapping them inside PHP code. Usually, this part of the application comes with a documentation that lists and documents each and
every aspect of these zones. Most of the defaults zones you probably see here are zones that limit access to the administration interface
and have no working role outside this interface. This does not mean you're limited. You can define your own zones, but without needed
PHP coding to make use of those zones, most of the zones you define here are useless.
