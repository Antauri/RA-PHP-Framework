SSH (In A Box) is actually the "Sheel In A Box" (google it) URL that we need to enable a built-in SSH term right in the administrative
interface of this project. Details on how to install this daemon on Linux are provided on the official page. We don't cover those basics,
but we required an URL to be filled in order to enable this feature.
