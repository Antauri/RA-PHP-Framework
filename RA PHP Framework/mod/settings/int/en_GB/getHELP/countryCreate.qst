We provide you with a database of countries, but if political factors decide that new countries should be born, than we allow you
to add those countries here (most unlikely, but who knows). For a country to be accepted you need to provide the ISO code, the
country name, the ISO3 and country specific code. Countries relate to users, so try to be careful when adding, erasing or editing
some of them as they have a major importance in your system and how it works!
