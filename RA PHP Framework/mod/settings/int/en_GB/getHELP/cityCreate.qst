If it happens that your users report that their city isn't yet in the database, we allow you to define the city here. This will allow
the users to properly choose their city from the specified list. To define a new city, some constrains are needed as so:
<ol>
	<li>Country: you need to select which country to map the city to;</li>
	<li>City: you need to enter the city name. This field must not be left blank;</li>
</ol>
