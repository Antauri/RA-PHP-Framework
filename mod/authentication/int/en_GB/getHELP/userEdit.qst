Users may need to change passwords or in some circumstances you'd need to update, erase or do changes to an user's profile. Also, you may even
want to promote an user from a restricted group to a more unrestricted one. Whatever the case, we provide you with such a mechanism, by editing the
form below. Take note that changes are instantly, so it's better that you assure yourself that the corresponding user is not using your project at
the moment of change, just to avoid dizzying the user you're editing.
