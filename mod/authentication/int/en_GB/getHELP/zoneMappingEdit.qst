Here you can change the flag (allowed or denied) for these mappings, which will allow you to give the possibility for your users
to use parts of your application or restrict access to them. Changes here will take effect imediately, so hope nobody is using a
feature you edit now! Try to be carefull when you edit permissions as you may make some of your users mad of changes
and bugs that can appear due to changes on a LIVE project!
