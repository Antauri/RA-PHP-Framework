An "Have A Mint URL" is an URL pointing to your own instalation of "HaveAMint.com", a project aimed at giving you a clear perspective of
the traffic going on through your project. As we currently don't keep records of who's visiting what, we provide this as an extension
to use other, more specific traffic monitoring tools designed just for the job.
